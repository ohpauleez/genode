VirtualBox configuration options
################################

The configuration requires an attribute named vbox_file with the name of the
vbox configuration to be used (.vbox).

<config vbox_file="file.vbox">

XHCI controller
===============

The virtual XHCI controller can be enabled with the following
configuration option:

<config xhci="yes">

IOAPIC
======

The virtual PCI model delivers IRQs to the PIC by default and to the IOAPIC
only if the guest operating system selected the IOAPIC with the '_PIC' ACPI
method and if it called the '_PRT' ACPI method afterwards. When running a
guest operating system which uses the IOAPIC, but does not call these ACPI
methods (for example Genode/NOVA), the configuration option

<config force_ioapic="yes">

enforces the delivery of PCI IRQs to the IOAPIC.

CAPSLOCK
========

<config capslock="ROM">

If the capslock attribute is set to "ROM", virtualbox will open a connection
to the ROM named "capslock" and expect in the top-level node a attribute
'enabled' (yes|no). If the ROM capslock differ from the internal VM capslock,
the VMM will trigger aritifical capslock key events to the VM.
